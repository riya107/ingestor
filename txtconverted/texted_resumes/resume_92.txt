Walt Disney brings Lewis Carroll’s fantasy story to life in this well done an-

such as the duchess with the baby pig and mock turtle, this version is
without a doubt the most famous Alice adaption made.
other information
Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of no-
blesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has conﬁdence in her social posi-
tion, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitle-
ment, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a “poky little
house,” and no toys. Additionally, she ﬂaunts her limited information base with anyone
who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners
as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude
and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.

About me
Alice is a sensible prepubescent girl
from a wealthy English family who ﬁnds
herself in a strange world ruled by imag-
ination and fantasy. Alice feels com-
fortable with her identity and has a strong
sense that her environment is comprised
of clear, logical, and consistent rules
and features. Alice’s familiarity with the
world has led one critic to describe her
as a "disembodied intellect". Alice dis-
plays great curiosity and attempts to
ﬁt her diverse experiences into a clear
understanding of the world.
