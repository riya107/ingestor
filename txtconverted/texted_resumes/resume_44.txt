RE-CONFIGURABLE MODULAR SPHERICAL SNAKE ROBOT | AT
IVLABS | TO BE SUBMITTED IN IR O S 2016
Sept 2015 – Presen t | Men t or: Dr . S hital S. Chiddarw ar | VNIT Nagpur, INDIA
•Working ondevelopment ofsnake robot consisting mechanically connected
multiple spherical bots.
•Design eliminates theproblems withexisting snake robots tohandle lateral
motions andcomplex gaitanalysis byleveraging Omni directional motion
capabilities ofspherical bots.
•Each spherical module works onthebarycenter offset principle withTwo
driving units incorporating Omnidirectional motion: a)Forpropelling therobot
forward. b)Forsteering thepropeller unit.

DESIGN, F ABRICA TION AND CONTROL OF ‘SW A Y A T’ A 20 DOF
HUMANOID (KID SIZE): | AT IVLABS | VNIT NAGPUR, INDIA
A ugus t 2014 – J anuary 2015 | Men t or: Dr . S hital S. Chiddarw ar
•Fabrication andMechanical Design: ItwasDesigned andSimulated in
SolidWorks.Parts arefabricated inCNC Milling. Some small partare3D
printed formore precision.
•Software Architecture: Complete Software Architecture wasdeveloped on
Ubuntu 12.04 using ROSGroovy platform. Multiple nodal communication was
done using ROSplatform fordatatransfer. Rosserial wasused tocommunicate
withhardware.
•Control system: Thekinematics forthestatic walking forthehumanoid robot
wassuccessfully implemented. Torque andspeed feedbacks were taken from
theDynamixel motors.
