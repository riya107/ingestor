ProjectsNew Strategy for Analysis of Concurrent Programs via Sequentialization
Supervisor : Prof. Subhajit Roy Aug '16 - Present
- Using CSeq for code-to-code translation of concurrent programs into equivalent sequential ones
- Devising solving strategies to reduce verication time on existing backends like CBMC
Improving Bug Localization Using Interpolant-Based Proofs
Supervisor : Prof. Subhajit Roy Jul '15 - Aug '16
- Devised a new method to improve the quality of bug localizations, in terms of reduced superuous
program locations, for a given set of passing and failing test-cases
- Interpolants are constructed from passing tests to derive softroadblocks. These roadblocks then
discourage localizations violating these interpolants, thereby improving bug localization quality
- Upto 45% improvement in localization quality as compared to the state-of-the-art tool BugAssist.
-Paper accepted in OOPSLA, one of the premier peer-reviewed conferences in Programming Languages
Using SAT/QBF-Solvers to Detect Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Hardware
Supervisors : Prof. Paolo Ienne and Mr. Andrew Becker May '16 - Present
- Summer internship project at the Processor Architecture Laboratory, EPFL, Switzerland
- Studied various side-channel attacks, mitigation techniques and their proofs of eectiveness using
formal methods
- Developed a QBF-Encoding technique to verify whether a cryptographic circuit is secure against a
popular side-channel attack based on fault-injection
- In the process of writing a paper and submitting to a peer-reviewed conferenceImplementation of DirectFix in CBMC
Supervisor : Prof. Subhajit Roy May '15 - Jul '15
- Ported the described Component-Based-Synthesis algorithm in DirectFix to CBMC
- Reproduced the experimental results provided in the paper, and devised further optimizations

ProjectsRe-Inventing A Median Algorithm for Disk-Resident Data
Supervisor : Prof. Surender Baswana Aug '14 - Nov '14
- Re-invented a two-pass deterministic algorithm to nd the median of large data-sets (approx. 1 TB)
- The algorithm developed was similar to the one described in the paper by Munro-Paterson (1980)
- Carried out extensive tests to evaluate the performance of the algorithm

Peer-to-Peer Dropbox
Supervisor : Prof. Subhajit Roy Aug '13 - Nov '13
- A linux application for backing-up and syncing les between two or more peers
- Users have a shared folder across dierent machines, with local copies. Changes made in any one
copy are synced across all devices
- Linux inotify API used to track changes in the shared folder and rsync used to sync the modications
to ensure ecient transfer
- Multithreading with mutexes used to parallelize syncing and le-monitoring operations

ProjectsEnd-to-End Compiler for Perl-like Language
Course : Compilers jSupervisor : Prof. Subhajit Roy Jan '15 - Apr '15
- Built an end-to-end compiler that takes a subset of the Perl language and outputs MIPS assembly
- Implemented Features such as operator overloading ,dynamic type-checking ,variable function argu-
ments ,hashes ,lists,type-based namespaces etc.

Integer Superscalar Processor Simulator based on MIPS-R10K
Course : Computer Architecture jSupervisor : Prof. Mainak Chaudhuri Jan '15 - Apr '15
- Implemented a superscalar processor simulator based on the MIPS R10K architecture with support
for integer instructions only
- Implemented support for Out-of-Order execution, multiple instruction issue and commit, precise
interrupts and branch-misprediction rollback
- Congurable parameters supported such as issue width, number of functional units, branch-
prediction algorithm, RAS/BTB size, active-list size etc.
- Performed experiments on various synthesized benchmarks to measure performance gains over an
in-order processor design. Repeated the experiment with varying parameter congurations
