PROJECTS
Course Allotment Simulation using SAT Solver :As part of Bachelors project, worked on solving the real world problem of
Ô¨Ånding a best course allocation under various constraints as a SAT (SatisÔ¨Åability) problem and infer effects of different policies on
course allotment and choices. Studied relative efÔ¨Åciency of various heuristics modeled on different solvers like MiniSAT and
Glucose.
IIT Bombay Hospital Digitization :Created a complete web application in Java that could handle operations on relational
MySQL databases to handle various processes of the university hospital.
Simple 2D Physics Engine :Wrote a physics engine for simple round bodies providing a back-end that could generate
coordinates in real-time with collision, gravity, restitution and custom resolution of time.
Social Sea :Create a lightweight social search engine that shows the results ranked (using page-ranking) according to one‚Äôs
peer-group search history and rating.
