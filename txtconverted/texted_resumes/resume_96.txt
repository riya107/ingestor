4 of52009 - Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda
2013 Part-time Lecturer
I conducted lectures, set, supervised and marked exam for the following courses to Computer
Science students (Bachelors and Diploma) in Makerere University Department of Computer
Science.
Courses taught: (Numerical Analysis, Further Linear Programming and Network Analysis, Dis-
crete Mathematics, Computer Literacy, Programming Methodology, Fundamentals of Mathe-
matics, Computer Architecture).
Accomplished Projects
•I have managed to automate all Roaming, Interconnect and Loyalty Campaign related processes and report-
ing with in a period of one month after joining Tenotree Corporation
•I was part of the team involved in the implementation of UTL Prepaid Commission Model, Churn, Prediction
Model and Micro Segmentation of UTL’s Subscriber base
•Implemented a real time raw CDR collector for prepaid UTL customers which resulted into timely, accurate
reporting and support for running various promotions (awakening and activation bonus promotions)
•Implemented a software solution using Perl to generate notiﬁcation Tap ﬁles for UTL inbound roamers. This
saved the company 40000 Euro that was required for regeneration of over 100,000 notiﬁcation by the Clearing
house
•Implemented a software solution using Perl to correct billing information for RAPs (Rejected Tap ﬁles for UTL
inbound roamers)
•Implemented a raw CDR decoder using Perl for MSC (mobile switch)
•Managed to resolve major Tap ﬁle exchange challenges between UTL and Data Clearing House (DCH). This
helped the company to recover from huge revenue losses that were caused by ﬁles aging before reaching the
DCH. This was achieved by implementing a number of controls and quality checks like successful ftp delivery
reports
•I was involved in the design, analysis and implementation (using python) of UTL bonus airtime model which
came in handy during a number of acquisition campaigns
•Implemented the good number algorithm in python for classiﬁcation of UTL free number pool
•I implemented a Near Real Time Roaming Data Exchange (NRTRDE) solution for roaming fraud detection
using python which save UTL over 100,000USD that was to be charged by the vendor to implement the same
solution. Solution is still being used by UTL
