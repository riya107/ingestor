EXPERIENCE
Insight Data Science June 2016 - August 2016
Fellow
Developed a program to analyze Fitness Tracker data and compare results with weather information
from Weather Underground, providing user with an analysis how to optimize their activity based on
past habits.
Wrote an API to web scrape Polar Loop Fitness Tracker data
Data was obtained with Selenium, Data was managed through SQL, Pandas and Scipy were used for
analysis, and Matplotlib was used for visualizations
NSF Graduate Research Fellow September 2013 - September 2016
Graduate Reseach Assistant
Analyzed multiple time series satellite data sets ( >1 Tb of data) to explore low energy ion loss in the
inner Plasmasphere
Developed an analytic model to demonstrate loss of ions from increased wave activity
Developed algorithm to properly account for variability in the low energy ion pitch angle measurements
when calculating partial ion densities.
