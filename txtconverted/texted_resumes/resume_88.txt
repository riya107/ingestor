WORK EXPERIENCE
Flipkart, India | Graduate Trainee Intern
Ravi Iyer | May 2015 - July 2015
•Worked on analyses of customer payment
behaviour with the Payment Gateways team
at Flipkart.
•Analyses were based on geographic and
demographic variables.
•Developed a tool which predicted the
feasibility of a certain percentage of discount
at category and vertical level.
IIT Roorkee | Research Intern
Prof. Anand Bulusu | May 2014-July 2014
•Derived a delay model for CMOS two stage
inverter buffer.
•Developed a tool (Perl and HSPICE) to
generate Look up tables for calculation of
delay for a single stage inverter, two stage
inverter buffer and static D latch.PROJECTS
Detection of nuclei in H&E stained images
using Convolutional Neural Networks
Prof. Amit Sethi | Ongoing
•Trained a CNN for a three class classification
problem - Nucleus, Non-Nucleus and
Boundary.
•Aim to reconstruct the original shape of the
nucleus using the boundary and nucleus
classes and various image processing
techniques.
Machine Learning mini-projects
Prof. Suresh Sundaram | Jan 2015 - April 2015
•Created a character recognition system for a
few alphabets and numbers using Bayesian
classifier.
•Image Segmentation using K means
clustering and Gaussian mixture models.
•Face recognition using Principal component
analysis and Fischer discriminant.
Wall Climbing Robot
Prof. Prithwijit Guha | Jan 2015 - April 2015
•Built a wall climbing robot which could
travel on flat as well as slightly uneven
surfaces.
