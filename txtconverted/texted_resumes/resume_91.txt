ObjectiveImprove the eÔ¨Éciency of the microwave and RF designers and structures. I focus on nonlinear devices
at circuits level (such as HEMTs transistors) and at system level (HPA, Switches). That purpose
requires an original use of an advanced RF instrumentation associated to a strong knowledge in
terms of measured devices modeling.
Skills Operating systems : DOS, Windows, Unix and Linux.
Programming languages : Pascal, 80x86 Assembler, C, C++, TCL/TK, JAVA, PHP, mySQL.
OÔ¨Éce softwares : Microsoft OÔ¨Éce, Open OÔ¨Éce, LaTeX, DocBook.
ScientiÔ¨Åc softwares Comsys, Maple, Matlab, Mathematica, Scilab, Keysight‚Äôs VEE and ADS,
NI LabVIEW.
Characterization tools : Spectrum analyzers, scopes, AWG, VNA, LSNA, probe stations, high
impedance probes. I have developed calibration procedures and automated calibration and
measurements processes.
System Level Modeling : AmpliÔ¨Åers, modulators and mixers with splines, neural networks or
Volterra expansions. Bilateral Modeling by PhD model.
Circuit Level Modeling : Linear, nonlinear and electrothermal models of HEMTs.
Languages : French, English.
